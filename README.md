# mg

Generative pixel grid. Part visualizer, part instrument, part mood.

Black and white by default. Color if you want it. Text that glitches. Patterns that breathe. Everything loops. Everything is deterministic. Same seed, same world — always.

---

Built in the spirit of constraint. Inspired by the formal language of artists like [Kim Asendorf](https://kimasendorf.com/) — the monochrome grid, the binary field, the aliveness in simplicity. Nothing here reproduces that work. The system, the rules, the rendering — all original. What's shared is a feeling: pixels doing something they shouldn't be able to do.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Controls

Hidden by default. `Cmd + .` to open.

| | |
|---|---|
| `Space` | play / pause |
| `← →` | walk seeds |
| `↑ ↓` | resolution (shift: big steps) |
| `[ ]` | subdivision (shift: big steps) |
| `+ -` | zoom in / out |
| `0` | reset zoom |
| `R` | randomize everything |
| `C` | randomize colors |
| `T` | toggle text overlay |
| `F` | toggle frame mode |
| `S` | save PNG |
| `Cmd + .` | show / hide UI |

Sliders for resolution, scale, subdivision, density, noise, warp, speed, period. BPM sync with tap tempo. Mouse interaction (hover attracts, click repels). Frame mode with aspect ratio, shape, and text controls. All state in the URL.

## How It Works

A seed determines everything. The canvas subdivides into rectangles via binary space partitioning. Each rectangle gets a fill rule — noise, dither, automata, reaction-diffusion, lines, streaks, columns, dots, checkers, gradient. Time loops on a circle. Events fire at predetermined moments. A scanning warp displaces pixels. Mouse proximity distorts space.

All randomness flows from a single 32-bit PRNG. No `Math.random()` in the render path. The canvas runs at grid resolution with CSS `image-rendering: pixelated` for that raw pixel aesthetic.

Text overlay generates cryptic words and glyphs from the seed, with character-level glitch animation.
